                            <p>There are hundreds of commercial property management software systems in the world. So why choose Booking Ninjas? Our clients come to us from all over the globe because we are able to integrate more apps and other 3rd party services into your PMS than any other software due to our close partnership with Salesforce. This strengthens the power and capabilities of our PMS which is better than starting from scratch on a PMS that doesn’t have the same implementation ability. So simply put, our biggest strength is our unparalleled access to the best technology on the software market.                                 </p>

                    <p>Technology has had a larger impact on society than any other industry in the world. It has changed the way we interact with each other and more importantly, how we do business. And the business that cares most about satisfying members of society? The hospitality industry. As we've explained in some of the <a href="#" class="blue">previous videos</a> on our YouTube channel, property managers need to be open to the idea of fully integrating technology into their business operations in order for their company to adapt to the 4th Industrial Revolution. </p>
                    <p>Here are some of the reasons why Booking Ninjas is considered the best property management software in the hospitality business. </p>

                                <h2>Mobility</h2>
                                <p>As the baby boomer generation grows older, it has become paramount for any property management company to offer an efficient mobile interface to serve their customer base. Booking Ninjas’ property management software is the best way for hoteliers and other commercial property managers to consolidate the various aspects of running their business and optimize their company to better serve their clientele. 
                                </p>
                                <p> All you have to do is go to any public place and you'll see more than half of the people you encounter looking at their phones. For better or worse, mobile technology is here to stay and as a property manager, you need to have a business model that fits the time we're living in. Some neat features that PMS mobility offers include mobile keys, faster check-in, management flexibility, smart guest experiences, and many more. Having a strong mobile platform also allows you to reach more customers and increase direct bookings. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Something that is becoming more frequent each year is the use of artificial intelligence in the hospitality industry.

A lot of people have a fear and paranoia of AI, but the truth is, it can be very beneficial to your property and the growth of your business. 

                                    </p>

                                <p>Getting feedback from your guests has never been more convenient. Instead of scrambling through third party travel sites, because of Booking Ninjas’ capacity for integration, you can now see whenever anyone leaves a review of your property in an instant. </p>

                                <p>   Furthermore, you can encourage direct feedback from your mobile-friendly cloud-based platform. More importantly, taking advantage of Salesforce Einstein AI, you can view in-depth customer preferences before they arrive at your hotel. The AI can also help improve your customer service by bringing up customer interaction history when a particular customer calls the property, so the agent has a better understanding of what call may pertain to.

                                <p>Since all of your property’s information is on one system, property managers may be a tad insecure about other staff members using it. Luckily, we're one step ahead of you. With a Booking Ninjas PMS property, you can control which accounts have access to specific  data on the platform. Make newly promoted staff members feel extra empowered by giving them unlimited access to the software and limit the access capability of those you don’t feel are ready to view the information.
