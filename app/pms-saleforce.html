                            <p>The Salesforce platform is constantly shaping itself to meet the demands of our current business environment while setting standards for a new digital age. From the field of cloud computing to Artificial Intelligence, Salesforce has always aligned its efforts into ensuring it gives the best experience to users of their services.

                <p>This is our plan, too, so we decided to team up with Salesforce to achieve that end. We plan to give the users of the Booking Ninjas system exceptional property management experiences and quality guest relationship management, more commonly known as customer relationship management (CRM). We understand that to provide such an experience, we must deliver in user experience, technology flow, scalability and other features that make an ROI more likely as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>A way to give that to our customers is by teaming up with the giant tech company, Salesforce, which has already shown that it could give similar experiences and outcomes to users. We are confident in this partnership, and we have had sensational results to prove us right.</p>

We have been able to launch the Booking Ninjas system on the Salesforce cloud platform, giving our users the flexibility cloud computing provides. This entails using a powerful application independent of time, location or device. Our software-as-a-service system, courtesy of Salesforce, means our users only have to type in the URL, put in their credentials and use the system.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>This method of software usage has been instrumental in delivering quality user experiences and guaranteeing productivity.

                                                It’s a critical feature of the industry. Due to exposure to rapid satisfaction brought about by the 4th Industrial Revolution, guests/customers today have higher expectations as to how they are attended to. It’s becoming obvious as more and more guests tend to book reservations via the internet, make payments online so they don’t have to deal with any time-wasting complications and chat with online bots for simple queries instead of sending emails.</p>

A recent report showed that 84% of businesses are stalled by integration challenges. These integration challenges are mainly due to the organization using a system that doesn’t favor integrations or doesn’t use any form of integrations at all.
